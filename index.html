            <p>Exercise not only helps you live longer â€” it helps you live better. In addition to making your heart and muscles stronger and fending off a host of diseases, it can also improve your mental and emotional functioning and even bolster your productivity and close relationships.</p>

            <p>Working out in the gym not only helps you shed those extra pounds, keeps you fit but also has a whole lot of health benefits. Regular exercise has been shown to improve cardiovascular fitness and decrease blood pressure and blood fat levels and decrease belly fat.</p>

            <p>But if you really want to hit the gym, you need to be at least 14 to 15 years old, though you should refrain from heavy lifting and concentrate on doing body weight exercises, yoga etc. If you want to lift weights, you could start off with light weights as your bones are still growing.</p>
